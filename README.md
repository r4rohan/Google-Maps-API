# Google-Maps-API
For this you have to enable your Google Maps API and paste the API in the index.html file in script tag. When you activate the API, 12 API will be activated, you can easily do it from this link: https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/ if you want to activate all 12 APIs otherwise you can do it by Cloud Console also. You have to enable billing for it, otherwise you can't enable your API.
You can get the Google Maps API from Google Cloud Console.
